Welcome to our repository for our exam project for finishing our second semester at EAMV.

This projects programming is inside the src folder and consists of different packages which have the normal naming convention for the 
modelview-control design pattern.

If you are using code from this project, we would like to ask you to include our names as authors of it, but only if the code is copied 
directly, if its just for inspiration, then go ahead and edit the code for your liking.

This project is mainly a solution for a bus service in Denmark, which can be ordered from an application to come pick citizens up,
mainly the eldery which needs some help with the helping-aids and luggage.

We made a solution in java, with all the nescessary graphs and diagrams which where a requirement from the assignment we got.

The process took 5 weeks from start to finish, including a 40 page paper on the project as a whole, and the work process within.
